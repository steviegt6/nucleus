# Copying

nucleus is a fork of [GooseMod/OpenAsar](GooseMod/OpenAsar). Both nucleus and OpenAsar are licensed under the MIT License (you can view our copy [here](LICENSE)).

nucleus reimplements the functionality of proprietary software but *not* through clean-room means, so copyright is up in the air right now.

## Included Software

As established earlier, nucleus is a fork of OpenAsar, and includes the original MIT License used by the project with additional copyright information prepended.

Additionally:
- a binary distribution of [pykeio/vibe](https://github.com/pykeio/vibe) is included (under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/pykeio/vibe/blob/main/LICENSE));
- a lightly-modified variant of [uwu/shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter)'s injector is included (under [CC0-1.0](https://github.com/uwu/shelter/blob/main/LICENSE)).
